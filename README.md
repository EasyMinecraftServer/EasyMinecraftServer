# Easy Minecraft Server
Easy Minecraft Server is a CLI app I'm developing to create Minecraft servers easily and automatically
I hope to support all Minecraft version and every mod loader/plugin framework

# Development
To setup a dev env you need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

Then run these commands
```
poetry install
poetry shell
pre-commit install
```
